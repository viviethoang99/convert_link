## Installation

- Check if you are in the beta channel of flutter SDK and the version v2.17.0 or higher. [Instruction to change flutter channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels#how-to-change-channels).
- Clone the repo

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/viviethoang99/convert_link.git
  ```

- And then we can use the normal build and run procedure

  ```sh
  flutter pub get
  flutter run
  ```

- Some files like `*.freezed.dart`, `*.g.dart`, `*.iconfig.dart` are auto generated. If there is any issue from these files just run this command to regenerate them.

  ```sh
  flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```

## Getting Started ðŸš€

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Convert Link works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

## Running Tests ðŸ§ª

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
